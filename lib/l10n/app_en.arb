Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:\n\nEmail address\nFirst name and last name\nPhone number\nAddress, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City\nUsage Data\nUsage Data\nWe may also collect information on how the App is accessed and used. This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address,screen name, device type, operating system version, the pages of our App that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.",

  "tpdisdata": "We may share your personal information in the following situations:\n\nWith Service Providers: We may share your personal information with service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our App, to contact you.\nFor Business Transfers: We may share or transfer your personal information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\nWith Affiliates: We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.\nWith Business Partners: We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.\nWith Other Users: When you share personal information or otherwise interact in the public areas with other users, such information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed outside.\nWith Your Consent: We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.",
  "tpscdata": "Strong Passwords: Use unique and complex passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdates or common words. Consider using a password manager to generate and store passwords securely.\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\nUpdate Regularly: Keep your software, apps, and operating systems updated. Updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities.\n\nEncryption: Encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest. This ensures that even if your data is intercepted, it will be unreadable without the encryption key.\n\nSecure Connections: Be cautious when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. Avoid accessing sensitive information or logging into accounts when connected to unsecured networks. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security.\n\nData Minimization: Only provide necessary personal information when required. Be cautious about sharing sensitive data online, especially on social media platforms.\n\nPrivacy Settings: Review and adjust the privacy settings on your online accounts and devices to control who can access your personal information.\n\nBackup Regularly: Regularly backup your important data, either to an external hard drive or a secure cloud storage service. In case of data loss or a security breach, having backups ensures that you can recover your information.\n\nBeware of Phishing: Be vigilant against phishing attempts, where attackers try to trick you into revealing personal information or login credentials through fake emails, messages, or websites.\n\nSecurity Software: Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on your devices and keep them updated. These programs can help detect and remove malicious threats.\n\nData Handling Practices: Be mindful of how you handle and share personal data. Avoid sharing sensitive information unnecessarily and be cautious about the information you provide to unfamiliar websites or individuals.\n\nEducation and Awareness: Stay informed about common security threats and best practices for protecting your personal data. Educate yourself and others, especially children and elderly family members, about online safety.",
